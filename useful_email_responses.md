Based on past emails we've sent, feel free to change as much as you need.

### New Workshop Enquiry

Great to hear that you're interested in setting up a ClojureBridge in your area.

To get you started here's some information on what's required to [organise a ClojureBridge in your area](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/organizing).

Once you're familiar with that and happy to proceed with organising, create an "issue" on the ClojureBridge GitHub repo to share information about the upcoming workshop. [More info on that here](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/Workshops).

If this is your first time organising a ClojureBridge workshop and/or if you'd like some extra support, we'll assign you a mentor to support and be a point of contact. That might be me or someone else on the [ClojureBridge board](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/board).   

Let me know if you have any questions about any of the above info.

### Partnership Request
Thank you for your email. ClojureBridge is an entirely voluntary organisation focused on increasing diversity within the Clojure community by supporting underrepresented groups in tech through free Clojure workshops. As such, it’s important to us that any partnerships we get involved in are both valuable to the community and relevant to ClojureBridge’s cause and we’d look for evidence of:

* Attempts to increase diversity in the programming community;
* Representation of traditionally underrepresented groups in the event speaker programme and attendee list;
* A publicly available diversity and inclusion policy;
* A code of conduct.

On provision of the above, we’d be glad to consider the offer of partnership.


Many thanks in advance
