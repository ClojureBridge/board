## PEX card

PEX card is a kind of debit card Bridge Foundry issues for an organization qualifies to the criteria. The Criteria is described in the BridgeFoundry doc, [PEX Card](https://github.com/bridgefoundry/operations/blob/master/using-funds/pex-cards.md).


### History

ClojureBridge as an organization won't meet BridgeFoundry's criteria since this organization doesn't organize workshops. Our PEX card is a sort of piggyback on Minneapolis team. Minneapolis team has been very active and already possesses the PEX card.

BridgeFoundry introduced us Chris Koehnen, who is an owner of PEX card and a member of Minneapolis team. Chris jumped in and is helping ClojureBridge as a board member now. After his joining the baord, our expenses are paid by PEX card. Before PEX card, our expenses have been paid by someone's credit card.


### Tips

#### Bulk account

Who used and how much are recorded on Google sheets(!). BridgeFoundry manually updates the spread sheets periodically. The spreadsheets also have a record of donations. A person who is responsible for fills in both donations and payments in the sheet for ClojureBridge. This way, we know how much are left so far. Some of board member have access to the spreadsheets. 


#### Reimbursement is hard

PEX card system is a bit different from normal credit/debit card. Accroding to Chris, reimbursment process is painful. We should talk to Chris before paying money by a peronal credit card.
