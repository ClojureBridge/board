# What is ClojureBridge?

ClojureBridge is a non-profit organization formed primarily to:

* Provide free, beginner-friendly workshops to teach women and other under-represented groups to program in Clojure.

* Welcome women and other under-represented groups to the Clojure community. Support, encourage, and celebrate their ongoing contributions to the Clojure ecosystem.

* Build empathy and training skills within the Clojure community.

ClojureBridge (and its sister organization, [RailsBridge](http://railsbridge.org/about)) is a subsidiary of [Bridge Foundry](http://bridgefoundry.org/), which is fiscally sponsored by the [School Factory](http://schoolfactory.org/) umbrella organization. School Factory is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit corporation. Since we are part of the School Factory umbrella, ClojureBridge is also a 501(c)3, which means that donations to us are tax-deductible. School Factory takes a percentage of all funds donated to ClojureBridge in return for handling our banking, accounting, and tax returns.

We expect everyone involved with ClojureBridge to follow the Bridge Foundry [Code of Conduct](http://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct/).

# A Bit of History

[Bridget Hillyer](http://bridgetconsulting.com/?p=119) and [Sean Corfield](http://corfield.org/blog/post.cfm/clojurebridge-workshops-coming-soon) have written blog posts about the origins of ClojureBridge.

# The ClojureBridge Organizational Structure

Like RailsBridge, ClojureBridge is a non-hierarchical, decentralized organization full of people who want to make tech better and are willing to donate their time and resources to that effort. Everything we do is open source and replicable by volunteers.

## Governance

ClojureBridge governs itself via the following entities:

* Board of Directors: responsible for financial and legal management, as well as matters of core identity & mission. See table below for details.

* Core Teams: See table below for a list of teams and their areas of focus. Each team has authority over its activity, and is given a great deal of latitude in designing its own operations.

Handles anything legalese: this is most likely to be mundane copyright & trademark matters related to Clojure.

Handles any corporate sponsorships that are broader than the local chapter level.

Meets roughly monthly.

### Terms of Service

Terms begin in either November or March. The term of service for all Board and Team members is one year. After one year, members may leave anytime by their decisions. The Board and Teams should coordinate the term dates of their memberships so that all members of a team don’t change at once.

Members can serve multiple consecutive terms, but we prefer that not be the norm. We want to prevent burnout, cultivate new leaders, and foster a resilient leadership structure. Having the same folks serve in the same positions ad nauseum doesn’t do that.

### Election/Nomination

Each November and March, the Board will announce open positions via the ClojureBridge Workshops mailing list. People interested in serving on the Board or a Team should self-nominate by emailing the ClojureBridge list.

If there are multiple candidates for an open position, the Team (or Board) with the open positions is responsible for deciding how to proceed. Options include:

* Accepting only one applicant

* Accepting multiple applicants (and thus increasing the number of people on the Team/Board)

* Accepting no applicants at that time

### Finance

Financial details, including non-profit status and our relationship to Bridge Foundry, is in a separate document: 

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQ8imgkgvON4onqYPbKY2DOHhr4d_BjOUtcCRY1_yf8/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQ8imgkgvON4onqYPbKY2DOHhr4d_BjOUtcCRY1_yf8/edit) 

### Decisions, Voting, & Conflict Resolution

Teams self-determine their decision-making and conflict-resolution behaviors, and generally require input/approval from the board only for matters listed below. 

The Board of Directors handles all decision involving:

* Accepting or giving money, including sponsorships, with the exception of activities related to individual workshops. For example, local organizers do not need the Board’s approval to accept sponsorships, unless those sponsors require invoicing or receipts from the central ClojureBridge/School Factory account.

* Legalities, including trademark & copyright 

* Changes to this document.

* Topics that are critical to the ClojureBridge’s core identity & mission. Who and what can call itself ClojureBridge, for example? This is inevitably a judgement call. That’s OK.

The Board of Directors follows this procedure for decision-making and conflict-resolution:

* Strive for consensus first. Hold discussions via the clojurebridge@googlegroups list and at real-time board meetings.

* Whenever possible & appropriate, the Board should solicit input from the larger ClojureBridge community via the ClojureBridge Workshops list.

* If a discussion is going nowhere, we’ll call for a vote to make a decision. The board requires a ⅔ majority agreement to approve a vote. That means ⅔ of all current board members. Negative votes must include either an alternative proposal or an explanation of reasoning. 

    * Any board member can call for a vote at any time via the mailing list or at a board meeting.

* Results of voting (not necessarily individual votes) are made public via the Workshops mailing list. Publicizing these votes is the responsibility of the Board.

* Votes are typically conducted at the regular Board meetings or electronically.
