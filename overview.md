**Please note:** This is an attempt to summarise and reflect the most recent state of the board and its responsibilities, replacing [this outdated document](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/board/commit/131d57764879796107e93e98e0108100b4852114).

# What is ClojureBridge?

ClojureBridge is a non-profit organization formed primarily to:

* Provide free, beginner-friendly workshops to teach women and other under-represented groups to program in Clojure.

* Welcome gender minorities and other under-represented groups to the Clojure community. Support, encourage, and celebrate their ongoing contributions to the Clojure ecosystem.

* Support and provide expertise and resources to new and existing ClojureBridge chapters across many cities worldwide. 

* Build empathy and training skills within the Clojure community.

ClojureBridge is a subsidiary of [Bridge Foundry](http://bridgefoundry.org/), which is fiscally sponsored by the [School Factory](http://schoolfactory.org/) umbrella organization. 

We expect everyone involved with ClojureBridge to follow the Bridge Foundry [Code of Conduct](http://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct/).

## A Bit of History

[Bridget Hillyer](http://bridgetconsulting.com/?p=119) and [Sean Corfield](https://corfield.org/blog/2014/06/21/clojurebridge/) have written blog posts about the origins of ClojureBridge.

# The ClojureBridge Board

ClojureBridge is a non-hierarchical, decentralized organization full of volunteers who want to make tech better. Everything we do is open source and replicable by volunteers.

## Board Responsibilities

The board currently meet remotely, on a quarterly cadence, to discuss and action:

* New chapter mentorship: walking them through the organizers' documentation and answering questions;

* Community Outreach & Support: triage and respond to enquiries via:
  * info@clojurebridge.org inbox
  * ClojureBridge, ClojureBridge Workshops, & ClojureBridge Alumni Google groups
  * Twitter and any other social media accounts
  * Mentorship requests via Github Issue

* Curriculum: Maintain the master curriculum & community docs, including handling pull requests.

* Web Site & Technical Infrastructure: maintenance and ad-hoc updates to [the ClojureBridge website](https://clojurebridge.org/), newsletter and social media accounts.

## Terms of Service

The typical board rotation is around 12-18 months. ClojureBridge board members may leave anytime any time after an ideal minimum term of one year. The Board should coordinate the term dates of their memberships so that all members of a team don’t change at once.

Members can serve multiple consecutive terms, but we prefer that not be the norm. We want to prevent burnout, cultivate new leaders, and foster a resilient leadership structure. Having the same folks serve in the same positions ad nauseum doesn’t do that.

## Finance

Financial details, including non-profit status and our relationship to Bridge Foundry, is in [this separate document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQ8imgkgvON4onqYPbKY2DOHhr4d_BjOUtcCRY1_yf8/edit): 

# Document Hygiene

The contents of this document will be reviewed and revised, if necessary, by the Board and all Teams twice a year.
