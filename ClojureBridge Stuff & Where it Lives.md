<a name="googleapps">[*1]</a>:
It used to be a Google Apps account. This provides email address for name@clojurebridge.org.
Now our account is a subdomain of BridgeFoundry.
We are NPO, so we can use it free (no payment required).
To Add/Remove account, ask BridgeFoundry core member.

<a name="mailchimp">[*]</a>
We don't need this. When our website moved to Github Pages, an email signup feature was removed.
Someone should contact Jamie since she may keep paying for it.

<a name="cognitect">[**]</a>
We are not using Cognitect's resource anymore. I'd like to leave Russ' name here for just in case.
FYI, we used Cognitect's Heroku account and AWS S3 bucket for the old clojurebridge.org website.
